## Project:

We decide to design and implement a visualization of HIV’s mutation in a human body and T-cell epitope mapping. A related visualization tool can be found through this URL:
	http://www.hiv.lanl.gov/content/sequence/jbrowse/?loc=Gag%3A1..500&tracks=PROTEIN%2CSub-protein_map&data=hivdata%2FEpitope-protein&highlight=

We will be cooperating with Andrew Gartland, a staff scientist at Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center and Mike Dapp, a Post-Doctoral HIV researcher in UW Immunology.

## Goal
The goal of the software is to assist in finding a potential cure for the deadly disease AIDS.

AIDS is caused by HIV, which is a highly mutable virus. Once HIV enters a subject’s system. The HIV virus will “evolve” to different types in order to escape from subject’s immune system. The virus evolves through a change in certain amino acid in its protein shell. 

According to Andrew, the scientist at Fred Hutch center, research shows that most people infected with HIV have T-cells that target specific region of the virus, known as epitopes, which are ineffective at recognizing the virus over time. Specifically, they target a part that is prone to mutation; however, a small minority of people known as “elite controllers” have T-cells that target a very unique set of epitopes and are able to control without ever developing AIDS.

So we want to build a tool to help spotting interesting region of the HIV’s protein sequence. And provide an intuitive and interactive view of the virus mutation trend. 

## Things to Visualize
1.	Variants of the specific Amino Acid in sequences
2.	HIV’s mutation direction in response to subject’s immune system
3.	Details of the epitope overlapping the mutated region

## Data
1.	HIV protein sequence from infected individuals
2.	Known T-cell HIV epitopes mapping

## Tool Set
1.	Tableau – exploration
2.	Adobe Illustrator – prototype, poster
3.	D3 - implementation
4.	MySQL (maybe)
